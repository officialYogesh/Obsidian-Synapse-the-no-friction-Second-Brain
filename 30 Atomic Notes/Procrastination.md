# Procrastination

## Core Concept
The act of delaying or postponing tasks.

## Context & Connections
- Often caused by fear of failure or perfectionism.
- Can be exacerbated by the [[Zeigarnik Effect]] - the more we delay, the more mental RAM it uses.
- See [[Productivity MOC]] for strategies to combat this.
