# Open Loops (Marketing)

## Core Concept
Using the [[Zeigarnik Effect]] in marketing copy. By creating an incomplete narrative or a question (an "open loop"), we create cognitive tension that compels the user to click or read further to "close" the loop.

## Context & Connections
*   **Application:** Subject lines, social media hooks, video intros.
*   **Risk:** If the payoff (closing the loop) isn't satisfying, it creates frustration (Clickbait).
*   **Related:** [[Copywriting MOC]]
