# Zeigarnik Effect

## Core Concept
The **Zeigarnik Effect** is a psychological phenomenon where people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.

## Context & Connections
*   **Mechanism:** It creates "task tension" in working memory. This tension is only relieved upon completion.
*   **Productivity Application:** This is why "Brain Dumps" work. Writing a task down convinces the brain it is "handled," reducing the tension.
*   **Relation to Procrastination:** [[Procrastination]] often increases this tension because we delay the closure.
