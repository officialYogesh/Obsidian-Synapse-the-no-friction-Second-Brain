## Key Insights
- We have a cognitive bias where we remember interrupted tasks better than completed ones.
- This creates "mental open loops."
- The only way to close the loop is to either finish the task or write it down (offload it).

## My Thoughts (Connections)
- This explains why my brain feels cluttered when I don't write things down.
- This is the core concept behind the [[Zeigarnik Effect]].
- It relates heavily to [[Procrastination]] - we avoid the task, but the mental cost remains.
