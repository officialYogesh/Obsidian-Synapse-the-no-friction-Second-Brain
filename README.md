**Synapse** is an Obsidian starter kit designed for people who want to **think**, not organize.

> **"The mind is for having ideas, not holding them."**

**Synapse** is built on **Human Psychology** (Association over Hierarchy) and **Archival Science** (The Zettelkasten Method), stripped down to the absolute essentials. It solves the "Notion Fatigue" of managing complex databases by prioritizing **writing first, linking later**.

---

## 🚀 Why this system?

Most systems fail because they require too much willpower (tagging, folder sorting, metadata) *before* you write. Synapse is designed to be **frictionless**.

*   **Capture Instantly:** A dedicated Inbox and Daily Log means you never wonder "Where do I put this?"
*   **Atomic Thinking:** Break big projects into small, linkable "Atomic Notes."
*   **Native Performance:** Relies on core Obsidian features (Search, Links, Graph). **No heavy plugins required.**
*   **Scalable:** Works for 10 notes or 10,000 notes without changing the structure.

---

## 📂 The Architecture

The system uses a "Flat Hierarchy" to minimize decision fatigue.

| Folder | Purpose | The Metaphor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `00 Inbox` | **The Capture Zone.** Dump raw text, drafts, and PDFs here. | *The Physical Tray* |
| `10 Daily` | **The Timeline.** Chronological log of your days. | *The Ship's Log* |
| `20 Atlas` | **The Structure.** Maps of Content (MOCs) to organize topics. | *The Map Room* |
| `30 Atomic Notes` | **The Knowledge.** 90% of your notes live here. Flat & linked. | *The Slip-Box* |
| `40 Sources` | **The Library.** Highlights from books, articles, videos. | *The Bookshelf* |
| `98 Attachments` | **The Storage.** Images and assets (hidden away). | *The Basement* |
| `99 Templates` | **The Tools.** Blueprints for new notes. | *The Factory* |

## ⚡ How to Use (The Workflow)

### 1. Capture (Daily)
Don't organize. Just write.
*   **Quick thoughts?** Put them in your **Daily Note** (`10 Daily`).
*   **Files/Drafts?** Drop them in **Inbox** (`00 Inbox`).

### 2. Process (Weekly)
Once a week, empty your Inbox.
*   **Tasks** -> Move to your To-Do app (e.g., TickTick, Todoist).
*   **Knowledge** -> Refine into an **Atomic Note** in `30 Atomic Notes`.
*   **Trash** -> Delete the noise.

### 3. Connect (Always)
Never leave a note alone.
*   Don't use folders to group things.
*   Use **Links** (`[[ ]]`).
*   *Example:* "This note about [[Habits]] reminds me of [[Dopamine]]."

## 🏷️ The Tagging System

While this system prioritizes **Links over Tags**, a minimal set of utility tags is included in the templates to help manage note status and types.

### Status Tags (The Lifecycle)
Track the maturity of your notes.
*   `#status/seed` 🌱 : **New Idea.** A rough draft or a fleeting thought. Needs work.
*   `#status/processing` ⚙️ : **Reading.** A source (book/article) you are currently taking notes on.
*   `#status/evergreen` 🌲 : **Complete.** A polished atomic note. Reliable knowledge you can reference forever.

### Type Tags (The Classification)
Automatically applied by templates to categorize content type.
*   `#type/daily` : Daily logs and journals.
*   `#type/idea` : Atomic notes and concepts.
*   `#type/source` : Books, articles, videos, and podcasts.
*   `#type/moc` : Maps of Content (Indexes).
