# 🧠 Obsidian Synapse: System Guide

> **The Goal:** A system that remembers for you, connects ideas like a brain, and requires zero willpower to maintain.

Welcome to your new **Second Brain**. This system is designed to solve the two biggest problems in knowledge management: **Friction** (it's too hard to write) and **Retrieval** (it's too hard to find).

---

## 1. The Core Philosophy
This system is built on **Association**, not Hierarchy.
*   **Don't Ask:** "Where does this file *go*?" (Folder thinking).
*   **Ask:** "What does this idea *relate to*?" (Network thinking).
*   **The Result:** You don't have to remember file paths. You just follow the thread of your own thoughts.

---

## 2. The Architecture (The Skeleton)
We use a "Flat Structure" to minimize decision fatigue.

| Folder | The Metaphor | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **00 Inbox** | **The Tray** | **Temporary.** Dump for raw texts, drafts, and PDFs. Goal: Empty it weekly. |
| **10 Daily** | **The Journal** | **Timeline.** Your chronological log. "What happened when?" Never delete these. |
| **20 Atlas** | **The Map** | **Structure.** Maps of Content (MOCs). Summaries that link to other notes. |
| **30 Atomic Notes** | **The Brain** | **Permanent.** The "Slip-Box." 90% of notes live here flatly. One idea per note. |
| **40 Sources** | **The Library** | **Reference.** Notes *about* books, articles, videos. |
| **98 Attachments**| **The Basement**| **Storage.** Images and files live here so they don't clutter your folders. |
| **99 Templates** | **The Tools** | **Blueprints.** Layouts for new notes. |

## 3. The Workflow (The Pulse)

### ☀️ Daily Loop (Capture & Log)
*   **The Daily Note:** Keep this open. Log meetings, quick thoughts, and "Stream of Consciousness."
*   **The Inbox:** If you find a PDF, an article, or write a long draft, dump it here.
*   **The Rule:** *Don't organize yet.* Just capture. Friction kills ideas.

### 📅 Weekly Review (Process & Connect)
Once a week (e.g., Sunday), look at your **Inbox**.
1.  **Trash it:** Was it just noise? Delete it.
2.  **Task it:** Is it something to *do*? Move to your Task Manager (e.g., TickTick, Todoist). Delete the note.
3.  **File it:** Is it knowledge?
    *   **Source:** Move articles to `40 Sources`.
    *   **Idea:** Extract the core concept into a new note in `30 Atomic Notes`.
    *   **Link it:** Connect it to at least one other note (`[[Related Topic]]`).

---

## 4. The Navigation (How to Find)
**STOP browsing folders.** You will never find anything that way.

*   **Method A: The Search (Primary)**
    *   Use `Ctrl/Cmd + O`. Type "Zeigarnik". It appears.
    *   *Why:* You remember *keywords*, not *locations*.
*   **Method B: The Chain (Context)**
    *   Search for `Productivity`. Open the note.
    *   Click the link to `[[Procrastination]]`.
    *   Click the link to `[[Zeigarnik Effect]]`.
    *   *Why:* This simulates how your brain surfs memories.
*   **Method C: The Graph (Safety Net)**
    *   Open **Graph View**. Toggle "Orphans" ON.
    *   Any dot floating alone is a "Lost Note." Link it to something.

---

## 5. The Golden Rules

### 🏷️ Tags vs. Links
*   **Tags (`#status/seed`)**: Use for **State**. "This is unfinished."
*   **Links (`[[Topic]]`)**: Use for **Content**. "This is about Psychology."
*   *Never tag a topic.*

### 🗺️ The "Critical Mass" Rule (MOCs)
*   **Do not create empty folders/MOCs.**
*   Wait until you have ~10 notes on a topic (e.g., "Marketing") and feel overwhelmed.
*   *Then* create `[[Marketing MOC]]` in `20 Atlas` and link your notes to it.

### 🧩 The Atomic Rule
*   **One Idea = One Note.**
*   Don't write a note called "My Thoughts on Life."
*   Write 10 notes: "Stoicism," "Habits," "Diet," etc.
*   *Why:* You can link "Habits" to "Productivity." You can't link "My Thoughts on Life" to anything specific without it being messy.

## 6. Maintenance & Safety Net

### 🔎 Recent Work
*To see what you worked on recently:*
1.  Check the **File Explorer** (Left Sidebar).
2.  Sort by **Modified Time (New to Old)**.

### 🛡️ Safety Net (Lost Notes)
*To find notes that are floating alone:*
1.  Open **Graph View**.
2.  Click **Filters** (Cog icon).
3.  Toggle **"Orphans"** ON.
4.  Link any dots you find floating on the edges.

## ❓ Common Questions

### Where should I spend my time?
**80% of your time** is spent in two places:
1.  **10 Daily:** Writing quick thoughts and logs during the day.
2.  **30 Atomic Notes:** Writing the actual permanent concepts (usually during your review sessions).

**You rarely visit:**
*   `00 Inbox` (only to empty it).
*   `20 Atlas` (only when you are lost).

### Do I need a Master Map (Index)?
**No.**
*   The `20 Atlas` folder *is* your index.
*   Since you give your MOCs clear names (e.g., `Productivity MOC`, `Marketing MOC`), looking at the file list in `20 Atlas` is enough.
*   **Don't over-organize.** Only create a "Master Index" note if you have 50+ MOCs and can't find them.

## 🚀 End-to-End Example: The "Zeigarnik Effect"

**Scenario:** You are reading an article about why open tasks stress you out.

### Step 0: The "Capture" (Daily vs. Inbox)
This is where the confusion usually happens. Here is how you use both in this scenario:

#### 1. The Daily Note (The Timeline)
*You are working. You don't want to stop.*
You open your **Daily Note** (e.g., `10 Daily/2025-11-30`) and type:
> *   09:30 - Reading about [[Zeigarnik Effect]]. Wow, this explains why clickbait works.
> *   09:45 - Meeting with Boss. (She agreed to the new budget).

**Why here?** Because "Meeting with Boss" is not a permanent knowledge note. It's a log. You will want to know *when* that meeting happened.

#### 2. The Inbox (The Object)
*You have a big chunk of text or a draft.*
You have a sudden idea for a newsletter strategy based on this effect. It's too long for a bullet point.
You create a **New Note** (Cmd+N), name it `Raw Text - Newsletter Strategy`, and dump your 3 paragraphs of text there. You leave it in **00 Inbox**.

**Why here?** Because this is a "Project Draft" that needs to be refined. It is not a "Log entry."

---

### Step 1: Process (The Transformation)
Later (e.g., Sunday), you review your work.
1.  **Review Daily Note:** You see the log about the "Zeigarnik Effect." You decide to make it a permanent note.
2.  **Review Inbox:** You see `Raw Text - Newsletter Strategy`. You realize this is actually a project. You move it to your Task Manager (because it's a task) OR you refine it into a permanent note `[[Marketing - Open Loops]]` in your `30 Atomic Notes` folder.

### Step 2: The Atomic Note
(Continuing from previous example...)
3. Create an **Atomic Note** in `30 Atomic Notes` named `[[Zeigarnik Effect]]`.

---

## 🔄 Phase 2: The Lifecycle (What happens next?)

You captured things. Now, how do they evolve?

### 1. The Inbox Item (`Raw Text - Newsletter Strategy`)
*   **Status:** Sitting in `00 Inbox`. It is clutter.
*   **The Action (Weekly Review):**
    *   Ask: *Is this a task?* -> Yes? Move to Task Manager. Delete file.
    *   Ask: *Is this knowledge?* -> Yes? Refine it.
*   **The Progression:**
    1.  You read the draft. You realize it's a marketing principle.
    2.  You rename it (or create a new note) to `[[Open Loops (Marketing)]]` and move it to `30 Atomic Notes`.
    3.  You link it to `[[Zeigarnik Effect]]`.
    4.  **Result:** `00 Inbox` is empty. `30 Atomic Notes` has a new valuable tool.

### 2. The Daily Note (The Date)
*   **Status:** Sitting in `10 Daily`.
*   **The Action (Daily/Weekly):**
    *   **DO NOT DELETE.** Daily notes are permanent records.
    *   **Scan for "Diamonds":** Did you write an idea down but forget to link it? (e.g., "Idea: Use open loops").
    *   **Scan for Tasks:** Did you write "Call John"? Move that to Task Manager.
*   **The Progression:**
    *   The note stays in `10 Daily` forever.
    *   It serves as the **Chronological Anchor**.
    *   *Example:* In 2 years, you wonder "When did I start thinking about Open Loops?" You check the "Backlinks" on the `Open Loops` note, and it points right back to this date.

## 📅 Review Frequency: The "Maintenance" Schedule

| Container | Frequency | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **00 Inbox** | **Weekly** | **Empty to Zero.** Process every file. File it (Atomic Notes), Act on it (Task App), or Delete it. |
| **10 Daily** | **Daily** (End of day) | **Scan.** Ensure no tasks were missed. Don't move the file. |
| **30 Atomic Notes** | **Never** | You don't "review" this folder. You visit notes only when you are *thinking* about a topic or searching. |
| **20 Atlas** | **Monthly** | **Gardening.** When a topic (like "Productivity") gets too big, update its MOC. |

*Your system is ready. Trust the process. Capture freely, link thoughtfully.*
